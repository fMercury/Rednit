# Project Title

Redlit is a dating DAPP on the Ethereum network that allows users to stake the relationships with LIT tokens. 

## Summary
REDLIT is a decentralized location-based social search mobile app that allows users to like or dislike other users.
The app allows users to start the spark of the relationship (a communication channel) by sending a token amount that the user offers.
In adition, the user who receives a request and decides to accept the proposal can also increase the spark of the relationship (offer more token).
As to much the relationship increases, the spark grows.
If the relationship is over, the channel will be closed and the corresponding balance will be sent to each user.
The information available to the users is based on pictures uploaded for the user and storage in SWARM, a short bio that users write themselves.
